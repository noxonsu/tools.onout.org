## How do I build, deploy and set up smart contracts?

### Build

See `README.md` of the smart contract repository for build instructions.

### Deployment

There are two ways to deploy a project:

- following the instructions of the smart contract repository `README.md`
- manually

### Manual deployment

In order to deploy a project manually:

- Compile smart contracts using **Remix**, **Truffle**, or **Hardhat**.
- Acquire **ABI** and **bytecode** for the smart contract in JSON format.
- If smart contract constructor requires any arguments, acquire them as well.
- Send a transaction through one of these providers:
  - [Deploy through **Web3js**](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.3/web3-eth-contract.html#deploy)
  - [Deploy through **Ethers**](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract-factory/)

Here's an example of deployment through **Web3js**:

- [Primary method of deployment](https://github.com/noxonsu/unifactory/blob/bb85d3c974948213a4f0e383f1dfbefd5f8bfd2a/src/utils/contract.ts#L18)
